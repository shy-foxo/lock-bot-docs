![Custom unlock options](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/CustomUnlockOptions)

Custom unlocks can be as simple as an unrestricted opening or as complex as requiring a keyholder to enable the unlock, with a predefined alloted unlock time while freezing (pausing) the main timer and the risk of getting extra time added if the alloted time is ignored. [Learn more about custom unlocks](/docs/lock-settings/unlock-options#custom-unlocks)



##  <Center>Safety at the forefront of design</Center>

Lock Bot was built out of frustration with the lack of user safety on other platforms. Emergency unlocks, blocking users, invalid code troubleshooter, and previous code recall all standard features. [Learn more about what we do to keep you safe](docs/safety)
