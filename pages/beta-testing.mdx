# <Center>Lock Bot Beta Testing</Center>

Lock Bot has a free and open beta bot to help test and catch bugs before they get integrated into the main bot. This also means you can get access and provide feedback to new features as they are being developed!

[Click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1120552362822615140) to invite the beta bot.

Feedback, discussion, patch notes, and announcements for the beta bot all happen within the [Lock Bot support server](), make sure to give yourself the beta testing role in the server to access these channels!

<Callout type="info">
  The beta bot uses the same database as the main bot! This means all of your locks and user profile data will be accessible on the beta bot as if it is the main bot, as it pulls its data from the same place.

Happy beta testing!
