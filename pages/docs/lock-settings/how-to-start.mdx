# How to create a lock with Lock Bot


<Steps>
### Step 1
 
To create a lock first run the command `/createlock`
 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This command, and most of Lock Bot commands need to be in a NSFW marked channel to be run, otherwise they will not show up in the commands list!
</Callout>

If the command is run you should get a menu just like this

### Step 2
 
Select `Select a setting` and then select `set min time` and add a time value

### Step 3

Once you have set a minimum time the **Start Lock** button should now be enabled and you can now press it to create a new lock. Thats it! You have created a lock!

While this is the bare minimum needed to get a lock started this is just scratching the surface of what Lock Bot can do. Check out the next sections to learn more about other Lock Bot features.
