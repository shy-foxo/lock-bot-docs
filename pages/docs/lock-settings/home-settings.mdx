### Set Min Time

Opens up a modal for you to set a minimum time for the lock. This is only option required to start a lock.



### Set Max Time

Setting a maximum time will create a time range between min and max when you create a lock. For example if you set a min time of 1 day and a max of 7, when the lock is created it will pick a time between 1 and 7 days.

<Callout type="info">
  You can always add more time after a lock is created at any time. However, only keyholders can remove time from a lock.
</Callout>

### Set Time Limit

A time limit sets a limit on how long the lock can exist for. If the lock surpasses the time limit then the lock will be able to be unlocked, even if the timer is frozen and or has more time remaining.

The time limit can be extended by you at any time once you have created a lock. However only you can change this, keyholders can not.
