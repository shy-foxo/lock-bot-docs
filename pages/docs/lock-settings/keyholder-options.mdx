### Disable Adding Keyholder during Lock

Toggles if you can add keyholder during the lock or not. By default this is set to false



### Add Keyholder

Allows you to add keyholders for your lock. You can set up to 5 users, once the lock is created every user will get a request to keyholder.

There are 3 ways you can add users as keyholders

- Select user from your [trusted user list]() - great for keyholders you use often
- Select a user - Only works from users in the server, use the search bar to find users easier or if they are not showing up
- Add user from user ID - Add a user from using Discords user IDs (e.g. `1107865216030617600`), can be used to add users who are not in the server with you
