🐛 Fixed a bug in the ping command causing an embed color to not display

🐛 Other small misc bug fixes and spelling fixes

🔧 Added tips in several places around the bot to help give helpful tips and ideas on how to use the bot

🔧 Blocking users now removes you from their trusted user list and removes them from being a keyholder from your lock as well as preventing them from interacting with you in any way

🛠️ Overhauled and improved error logs and tracking

🛠️ Greatly improved data structures and interfaces internally

## Version 1.3.0

➕ Added the stats command

➕ Added status to the bot, these change every hour

🐛 Fixed a bug causing the custom unlocks to not function correctly

🐛 Fixed a few spelling/markdown errors

🔧 Overhauled the codebase, replacing all JavaScript with Typescript and fully moving to the new import file system

🛠️ Added user and bot stats, user stats will be visible later in hopefully the next major update

🛠️ Improved lock fetching

## Version 1.2.1

🐛 Fixed a bug causing the lock command to not update after your lock updates

## Version 1.2.0

🔧 Overhauled how the bot handles codes internally

➕ The bot now stores your last 5 codes, these can be viewed with /viewcodes. This does not show codes before this update or codes created in the last 20min or active codes 

➕ You now have the options to create a code between 3-6 digits, submit your own code or submit your own tag. Tags are considered public and will be shown on your /lock 

➕ Generated codes are now given to the user in a random order to try to eliminate the possibility for remembering the code

➕ Codes are now stored the moment they are created removing the possibility of a lock out if the menu times out. In addition the createLock menu will return you your code if the menu times out

➕ When a code is presented to the user it now asks if the code works or not, if the user hits does not work it launches into a troubleshooter mode to try to help the user

➕ The bot is now storing lock created and lock finished stats to be used later

🛠️ Minor bug fix and minor internal clean up 




## Version 1.1.0

Partly rebuilt the lock command, the menu system is now more consistent with the createLock command which is more scalable

Once you start or end a lock the bot will now mention the command instead of just the command name
