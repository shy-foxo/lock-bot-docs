# <Center>Trusted Users</Center>

Trusted users are users that have an elevated level of trust and permissions with your account, think of it like a friends list. Trusted users can view your profile even if your account is private and they are also more easily accessible to add as a keyholder when creating a lock.

## <Center>Adding and Removing Trusted users</Center>

Adding and removing trusted users is very similar to blocked users, in which there are 2 ways to add and remove users from your trusted user list.
