# <Center>Blocking users</Center>

Blocked users can not interact with your account. They can no longer view your profile, keyholder your lock, or otherwise interact with you. Users you block can also not be a [trusted user](/docs/user-settings/trusted-users).



## <Center>How to Block and Unblock Users</Center>

You can block users in two different ways. 

The first method is looking at the users profile, hitting the `User Options` button and then hitting `Block User`

The second option is to use the `/block` command and to provide a user option.

<Callout type="warning">
  Blocking users in Lock Bot does not block users in Discord, it is highly recommend that any users you block in Lock Bot you also block [in Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488-Blocking-Privacy-Settings).
</Callout>

To unblock users use one of the methods above. The `Block User` Button will be a `Unblock User` button and running the `/block` command and provided a blocked user for the user option, this will remove them from the blocked user list.



## <Center>How to View your Blocked Users</Center>

You can view your blocked users at any time by running the `/block` command without providing any user options.
