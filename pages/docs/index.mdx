# Introduction

Welcome to the Lock Bot Documentation!

Here you can find detailed information about Lock Bots features and systems, often more in depth than what the bot itself provides.

## Getting Started

To use Lock Bot, you will either need to [invite it](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1107865216030617600&permissions=379968&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to a Discord server (requires you to have manage server permissions), [install](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1107865216030617600&scope=applications.commands&integration_type=1) to your user account or join a server that already has Lock Bot. If you would like to join a server that the bot is already in, we recommend you join [Lock Bots support server](https://discord.gg/cGv8szjzSf).

<Callout type="warning">
  Due to the adult nature of this bot, most commands are restricted to NSFW (age restricted) channels. If a channel is not marked as NSFW Lock Bots commands will NOT show up. To mark a channel as NSFW, go to Channel Settings -> Overview, then Toggle "Age Restricted Channel" on.

## How to use Lock Bot

Now that you have access to Lock Bot [click here](/docs/lock-settings/how-to-start) for a quick guide on how to create your first lock!

Want to create a profile without making a lock? Run the `/profile` command and hit "confirm" to the prompt asking you to create an account. You can delete your account [at any time](privacy-policy#deleting-your-data). This command is also how you update your settings.

Otherwise, all commands can be found by typing `/` and selecting the Lock Bot icon. You can also click the apps button on the far right next to the chat bar in Discord and select Lock Bot.
