## Getting Started

To use Lock Bot you will either need to [invite it](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1107865216030617600&permissions=379968&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to a Discord server that you own or have manage service permissions in or join a server that already has lock bot. If you would like to join a server we would recommend you join [Lock Bots support server](https://discord.gg/cGv8szjzSf).

<Callout type="warning">
  Do to the adult nature of this bot, most commands are restricted to NSFW (age restricted) channels. If a channel is not marked as NSFW Lock Bots commands will NOT show up. TO mark a channel as NSFW go to channel settings -> overview -> toggle age restricted channel on.

## How to use Lock Bot

Now that you have access to lock bot [click here](/docs/lock-settings/how-to-start) for a quick guide on how to create your first lock!

Want to create a profile without making a lock? Run the `/profile` command and hit confirm to the prompt asking you to create an account. You can delete your account [at any time](privacy-policy#deleting-your-data). This command is also how you update all of your settings.

Otherwise all commands be found by typing `/` and selecting the Lock Bot icon or by clicking the apps button on the far right next to the chat bar in Discord and selecting lock bot.
