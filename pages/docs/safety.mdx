### How Lock Bot Handles Codes

Codes are an essential part of Lock Bot. They help ensure your keys are not easily accessible when a lock is ongoing. However, unlike some services, using is optional in Lock Bot. Therefore, if you are uncomfortable using codes or do not have the means to, you can still easily use Lock Bot.

<Callout type="info">
  NOTE If you create a lock without a code, it will not count time towards your stats unless you enable codeless stats in your user settings.
</Callout>

Also, unlike most other services, Lock Bot supports tamper seals. These seals act as one time "locks" to secure your lock or keys while allowing access at any time. Each seal includes a code that you can use to verify that you have not replaced it. The bot displays these codes publicly in the lock menu. They otherwise function as any other code would.

Whenever a code is created, regardless of type, it gets stored into the code pool attached to your user account. This pool always stores the last five codes, and the active code is stored within the lock itself. This pool of historic codes can be accessed at any time by using the `/viewcodes` command.

![The viewcodes command](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/ViewCodesCommand)

This command displays the last five codes, but it hides the current active code and any other codes created within the last 15 minutes. If you need access to a hidden code, [learn how Lock Bot's staff can help](#ending-locks).


Whenever you unlock your lock—whether for a custom unlock, finishing a lock, or another reason—the bot will provide you with your lock’s code. When the bot presents a code, it will ask you whether the code works. This prompt, part of Lock Bot’s code troubleshooter, helps you troubleshoot your code if it is not working.

![Lock Bot asking if the code works or not](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/codeConfirmation)

If your code is correct, then no action is needed; you can either let the menu time out or click "Code works," which closes the menu. Clicking "Code does not work!" launches Lock Bots code troubleshooter. This troubleshooter provides the code along with tips and suggestions on how to resolve the incorrect code.

![Lock Bot asking if the code works or not](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/InvaildCodeTroubleshooter)

<Callout type="default">
  We recommend that you keep one key easily accessible and independent of Lock Bot. Despite our best efforts to maintain data and stability, it is impossible to guarantee that your data will always be accessible. [Read more](#how-lock-bot-keeps-you-safe) about how we host Lock Bot.

### Emergency Unlocks

By default, all locks have an emergency unlock option enabled. This allows the user to end the lock early in the event of an emergency. However, this also means the lock can not be resumed like a custom unlock option nor does this count towards the user's finished lock statistics.

To activate an emergency unlock, run the `/lock` command, select "Unlock options," then select the "Emergency Unlock" option. You will then be unlocked.

![Activating the emergency unlock](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/emergencyUnlock)

Emergency unlocks are optional and can be disabled on a per-lock biases. They are always enabled by default when making a new lock. To disable the emergency unlock option, go to the "Unlock Options" section in the `/createlock` menu and toggle emergency unlock off.

Staff and any keyholders can end a lock early if necessary, even if the emergency unlock option is disabled [Click here](#ending-locks) to learn more about how Lock Bot staff can help.



### Blocking Users

Lock Bot allows users to block any user at another time for any reason to prevent them from interacting.

Blocked users can-not view your profile or keyhold your lock. If a blocked user tries to view your profile or update an old profile view, the bot will show them an error message.

![Error message returned trying to view a blocked users profile](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/blockedErrMsg)

If you block a user that is currently keyholding your lock, Lock Bot will remove them as a keyholder, and they will no longer have any access to your lock. The bot will also automatically remove them from your trusted user list.

To block a user, use the `/block` command with a user argument or by clicking the "User Options" button under their profile and then clicking block.

For more information about blocking users, please visit the [blocking command guide](/docs/user-settings/blocking-users).

<Callout type="warning">
  It is also highly recommended you block any users you block in Lock bot [on Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488-Blocking-Privacy-Settings) as well.
</Callout>



### Reporting Users

<Callout type="warning">
  There is currently no report system in Lock Bot, but this feature is coming soon. Until then, please [join our support server](https://discord.gg/cGv8szjzSf) and reach out to staff directly to report any users.
</Callout>



### Private Accounts

Lock Bot allows you to make your account private, preventing non-trusted users from viewing your account and your commands.

Marking your account private will make the bot send all lock commands responses in private messages (e.g., `/lock` and `/createlock`), so that only you can see their responses. Users also can-not view your user profile unless they are in your [trusted user list](/docs/user-settings/trusted-users) or are a pending or approved keyholder on a current lock.

This feature can be enabled or disabled at any time by running the `/profile` command, clicking `settings`, and toggle the `private` option.

[Click here](/docs/user-settings/settings#private) to learn more about private accounts.



## How Lock Bot Keeps you Safe

Lock Bot is hosted on a [DigitalOcean droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets) that only two people have access to. We use a [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/) database on this server, which stores its data in a [digitalocean storage volume](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/volumes/details/features/).

> "Volumes store data on hardware that is separated from the Droplet and replicated multiple times across different racks, reducing the chances of data loss because of hardware failure."

Lock Bot's database is also backed up daily to a [DigitalOcean storage space](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces). 

This means that the chance of downtime or any data loss is incredibly low, but not completely impossible.

We will try to give as much notice as possible to any planned downtime. We recommend you follow our status updates channel in our [support server](https://discord.gg/cGv8szjzSf) for  Lock Bot's status updates. 



## What Lock Bot's Staff Can Do

In situations where all your other options listed above can-not be used, our staff team may be able to help. However, please make sure all your other options are exhausted before contacting our staff.

All staff actions documented here are logged internally to prevent any of these tools from being abused.

### Ending Locks

If you can-not end your lock and you do not have a keyholder, Lock Bot staff can force a lock to end. This works similar to when a keyholder force ends a lock. The lock will be stuck in a "ready to be unlocked" state and it cannot be resumed.

![End Lock DM](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/EndLockDMExample)


### Unfreezing Locks

If your lock is frozen and you do not have a keyholder or any other way to unfreeze your lock Lock Bot's staff can unfreeze your lock. However, we recommend creating a new lock to avoid getting trapped in this state.


### Force All Codes

In the event you need access to all your codes found in the `/viewcodes` command, Lock Bot staff can help. Staff can force all codes, including hidden codes, to be visible to you.
