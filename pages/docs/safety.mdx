### How Lock Bot Handles Codes

Codes are a core part of Lock Bot, they help you make sure your keys are not easily accessible when a lock is ongoing. However, unlike some services, codes are not required for locks in Lock Bot, so if you do not feel comfortable setting one or do not have the means to you can still easily use Lock bot.

<Callout type="info">
  NOTE If you create a lock without a code by default it will not count time towards your stats unless you enable codeless stats in your user settings.
</Callout>

Also unlike most other services Lock Bot also supports lock seals, these being one time use "locks" to lock your keys away while allowing them to be accessed at any time. Aside from the fact that this code is considered public and is displayed on the lock menu, it otherwise functions as if it is any other code.

Whenever a code is created, regardless of type, it gets stored into the code pool attached to your user account. This pool always stores the last 5 codes, and the active code is stored within the lock itself. This pool of codes can be accessed at any time by using the `/viewcodes` command.

![The viewcodes command](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/ViewCodesCommand)

All past codes will be displayed but the current active code and any codes created within the last 15 minutes will be hidden. If you need access to a hidden code [learn how Lock Bot's staff can help](#ending-locks).


Whenever you are being unlocked, weather that be for a custom unlock, finishing a lock, ect, if you have a code set it will be presented to you. If a code is presented to you it will ask you if the code works correctly or not, this is Lock Bots code troubleshooter to help in case your code does not work as intended.

![Lock Bot asking if the code works or not](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/codeConfirmation)

If your code is correct no action is needed, you can either let the menu time out or select "Code works" which just closes the menu. Hitting "Code does not work!" however launches Lock Bots code troubleshooter. This provides the code along with tips and suggestions on how to resolve the incorrect code.

<Callout type="default">
  We recommend that you keep one key easily accessible independent of Lock Bot. Despite our best efforts to maintain data and stability it is impossible to guarantee that your data will always be accessible. [Read more](#how-lock-bot-keeps-you-safe) about we host Lock Bot.

### Emergency Unlocks

By default, all locks have emergency unlock option enabled. This allows the user to end the lock early in the event of an emergency. However, this also means the lock can not be resumed like a custom unlock option nor does this count towards the users finished lock statistics.

To active an emergency unlock, run the `/lock` command, click unlock options and then select the emergency unlock option, you will then be unlocked.

![Activating the emergency unlock](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/emergencyUnlock)

Emergency unlocks are however optional and can be disabled but they are always enabled by default when making a new lock. To disable the option of an emergency unlock go to the unlock options section in the `/createlock` menu and toggle emergency unlock off.

Staff and any keyholders can end a lock early if need be even if the emergency unlock option is disabled, [click here](#ending-locks) to learn more about how Lock Bot staff can help.



### Blocking Users

Lock Bot allows users to block any user at any time for any reason to prevent them from interacting with themselves. 

Blocked users can not view your profile or keyholder your lock. If a blocked user attempts to view your profile or update an old profile view they will be greeted with an error message.

![Error message returned trying to view a blocked users profile](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/blockedErrMsg)

Additionally if a user is a keyholder for your lock when you block them they will be removed as a keyholder and no longer have any access to your lock. They will also be automatically removed from your trusted user list if they are in it.

To block a user either use the `/block` command followed by the user argument or by clicking the user options button under their profile and then hitting block.

For more information about blocking please visit the [blocking command guide](/docs/user-settings/blocking-users).

<Callout type="warning">
  It is also highly recommend that any users you block in Lock Bot you also block [in Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488-Blocking-Privacy-Settings).
</Callout>



### Reporting Users

<Callout type="warning">
  Their is currently no report system in Lock Bot, it will be coming soon. In the mean time please [join our support server](https://discord.gg/cGv8szjzSf) and reach out to staff directly to report any users.

## How Lock Bot keeps you Safe

Lock Bot is hosted with a [DigitalOcean's droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets) that only 2 people have access to. We use a [rethinkdb](https://rethinkdb.com/) database that is hosted on the droplet with its data being stored in a [digitalocean volume](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/volumes/details/features/).

> "Volumes store data on hardware that is separated from the Droplet and replicated multiple times across different racks, reducing the chances of data loss because of hardware failure."

On top of this, Lock Bot's database is also backed up daily to a [digitalocean space](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces). 

This means the chance of downtime or hardware failure causing any data loss is incredibly low, but not technically impossible. 

We will try to give as much notice as possible to any planned downtime, we recommend you follow our status updates channel in our [support server](https://discord.gg/cGv8szjzSf) for updates about Lock Bot's status. 



## What Lock Bot's Staff can do

In situations where you all your other options listed above can not be used our staff team might be able to help. However please make sure all your other options are attempted first before coming to staff.

All staff actions listed below are logged internally. This is to prevent any of these tools being abused.

<Callout type="info">
  If you need to reach out to staff for any of the issues below please [join our support server](https://discord.gg/cGv8szjzSf).

### Ending Locks

In the event that you can not end your lock and you do not have a keyholder, Lock Bot staff can force a lock to end. This works much the same way as when a keyholder force ends a lock, where the lock will be stuck in a ready to be unlocked state and it can not be resumed.

![End Lock DM](https://cdn.lock-bot.com/EndLockDMExample)


### Unfreezing Locks

If your lock is frozen and you do not have a keyholder or any other way to unfreeze your lock Lock Bot's staff can unfreeze your lock. However it is recommended, if possible to create a new lock to avoid getting trapped in a stuck state. 


### Force All Codes

In the event you need access to all of your codes found in `/viewcodes` Lock Bot staff can help. Staff can force all codes including hidden codes to be visible to you.
